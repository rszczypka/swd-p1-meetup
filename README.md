# Project 1: Meet-up Event Planner
## Udacity - Senior Web Developer Nanodegree

The application allows you to name your event, search for a host location (using a location API like Foursquare), 
set the capacity of the event, the start and end times, and input a description of the event.

### Features
* Account creation, event creation and event display
* It is a joy to use on both desktop and mobile. On mobile, all forms are fully functional and react to touches 
naturally.
* The app is accessible (all forms are understandable while using a screen reader)
* The user experience is enhanced with prompts (labels, placeholders, error messages, etc) that appear in logical order 
and are phrased in friendly, human language.
* The inputs are kept to minimum to keep the end user happy and they are instantly validated (not later than on blur) 
keeping the user informed 
and avoiding submitting invalid information.
* Forms can be prefilled with existing user data.
* All input have appropriate types and are labeled (even if only for screen readers).
* The autofocus is applied to the first field above-the-fold.
* The required fields are kept to minimum

### Technical details
* The app includes a build process (using npm)
* Assets are minimized and concatenated as appropriate
* A solid starting point achieved with (https://github.com/mezod/boilerplate-koa-redux-react)
